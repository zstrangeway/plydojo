# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
PlyDojo follows a serverless architecture using SST (Serverless Stack) with a modern React frontend.

## Key Design Patterns

### Frontend Patterns
- **Component-based architecture**: UI elements are broken down into reusable components
- **State management**: [Describe approach - Context API, Redux, etc.]
- **Container/Presenter pattern**: Separating logic from presentation components
- **Custom hooks**: For reusable logic across components

### Backend Patterns
- **Serverless functions**: Lambda functions for API endpoints
- **Event-driven architecture**: Using AWS events for workflow triggers
- **Data access layer**: Abstraction over database operations
- **Authentication middleware**: For securing API routes

### Cross-cutting Concerns
- **Error handling**: Standardized approach to error reporting and handling
- **Logging**: Structured logging with context for traceability
- **Configuration management**: Environment-based configuration
- **Feature flags**: For controlled rollout of new features

## Major Technical Decisions

### [Decision 1 - Date]
**Context**: [Background information]
**Decision**: [What was decided]
**Rationale**: [Why this decision was made]
**Consequences**: [Implications and impact]

### [Decision 2 - Date]
**Context**: [Background information]
**Decision**: [What was decided]
**Rationale**: [Why this decision was made]
**Consequences**: [Implications and impact]

## Domain Model

### Core Entities
- **User**: Represents a registered user of the platform
- **Game**: A chess game with moves, state, and metadata
- **Analysis**: Engine and AI analysis of a position or game
- **Lesson**: Structured learning content

### Key Relationships
- A User can have multiple Games
- A Game can have multiple Analysis entries
- Lessons can be linked to specific game positions

## API Design
- RESTful API design for core CRUD operations
- WebSocket for real-time updates during gameplay
- GraphQL considerations for complex data requirements

## Performance Considerations
- Client-side caching strategies
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Server-side optimizations for chess engine calculations

## Security Model
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and throttling

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing for compute-intensive operations
