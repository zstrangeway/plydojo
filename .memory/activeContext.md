## Current Focus
**Priority 1.3 DevOps/CI-CD COMPLETED** - Complete CI/CD pipeline implemented with cost-effective workflow. All infrastructure priorities complete. Ready to proceed with authentication system implementation.

## Recent Changes
- **COMPLETED Priority 1.3**: DevOps/CI-CD pipeline fully implemented
- Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows:
  - PR validation (lightweight testing without deployment)
  - Staging deployment (merge to main → deploy → E2E tests → trigger production)
  - Production deployment (manual approval → deploy → smoke tests → rollback on failure)
- Enhanced monitoring with CloudWatch alarms, SNS notifications, and dashboards
- Local development setup script for robust testing without Docker
- Comprehensive CI/CD documentation with troubleshooting guide
- Cost-optimized workflow avoiding expensive feature branch deployments

## Current Status
**Documentation Quality**: Excellent - comprehensive, aligned, and consistent
**Implementation Progress**: Priority 1.1 ✅, Priority 1.2 ✅, and Priority 1.3 ✅ COMPLETED
**Infrastructure**: Fully deployed and operational with monitoring
**CI/CD Pipeline**: Complete with automated rollback capabilities
**Knowledge Graph**: Clean and accurate representation
**Ready for Next Phase**: Authentication system implementation (Priority 2.1)
