## Current Focus
Memory bank analysis completed - verified documentation integrity and identified critical implementation gap between planned architecture and current codebase state

## Recent Changes
- Completed comprehensive memory bank review and knowledge graph analysis
- Verified all 7 required memory bank files exist and are well-structured in .memory/ directory
- Confirmed documentation alignment completed on 2025-05-24 with 100% consistency
- Identified critical discrepancy: documentation describes fully planned system but actual implementation is minimal
- Cleaned and reorganized knowledge graph with accurate project state representation
- Verified current codebase is in template state with Next.js/shadcn setup but no chess functionality

## Current Status
**Documentation Quality**: Excellent - comprehensive, aligned, and consistent
**Implementation Reality**: Template state - basic monorepo structure exists but no core features implemented
**Knowledge Graph**: Clean and accurate representation of current project state
**Ready for Development**: All planning complete, architecture decided, ready to begin actual implementation

## Critical Gap Identified
The documentation describes a fully planned system with comprehensive specifications, but the actual codebase contains only:
- Basic Next.js app in apps/plydojo-web with shadcn/ui template
- Empty directories for apps/plydojo-api and apps/plydojo-infra  
- No chess functionality, AI integration, authentication, or database implementation
- This is expected and appropriate for current project phase

## Blockers
- None - documentation and planning phase is complete and ready for implementation

## Next Steps
- [ ] **Priority 1.1**: Frontend Setup - Configure chess-specific React components and state management
- [ ] **Priority 1.2**: Backend Infrastructure - Set up SST with DynamoDB and Lambda functions
- [ ] **Priority 1.3**: Authentication System - Implement AWS Cognito integration per specifications
- [ ] **Priority 2.1**: Chess Engine Integration - Add Stockfish.js for opponent AI model
- [ ] **Priority 2.2**: AI Tutor Integration - Add OpenAI API for tutor AI model

## Memory Bank Quality Assessment
✅ **Excellent**: All 7 required files present and comprehensive
✅ **Consistent**: Information aligned across all documents using screensList.md as source of truth
✅ **Accurate**: Documentation correctly reflects planning state vs implementation reality
✅ **Complete**: Architecture decisions, API contracts, database schema all well-defined
✅ **Actionable**: Clear development plan with 27 prioritized features ready for implementation

## Knowledge Graph Status
✅ **Clean**: Previous conflicting information removed
✅ **Organized**: Entities structured according to memory bank categories
✅ **Accurate**: Reflects actual project state (planning complete, implementation beginning)
✅ **Comprehensive**: Covers project overview, status, architecture, database, and development plan

## Relevant Files
- `package.json`: Main project configuration
- `.memory/`: Complete, aligned project documentation
- `.memory/developmentPlan.md`: Aligned development roadmap with 27 prioritized features
- `.memory/screensList.md`: Canonical source of truth for all requirements
- `.memory/apiContracts.md`: Aligned API specifications
- `.memory/lambdaFunctions.md`: Aligned implementation specifications
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: Workspace configuration
- `packages/plydojo-ui`: UI component library
- `apps/plydojo-web`: Main web application
- `apps/plydojo-api`: Backend API (to be implemented)
- `apps/plydojo-infra`: Infrastructure configuration (to be implemented)

## Notes from Latest Analysis

**Memory Bank Strengths:**
- Complete 7-file structure with additional specialized documentation
- Excellent information organization and consistency
- Clear separation between planning and implementation phases
- Comprehensive technical specifications ready for development

**No Major Issues Found:**
- Architecture decisions are well-reasoned and documented
- Database schema is complete and properly designed
- API contracts are comprehensive and aligned
- Development plan prioritizes features logically

**Implementation Readiness:**
- All planning work complete and documented
- Technology stack decisions finalized
- Database schema designed and validated
- API endpoints specified with contracts
- User flows mapped to backend functionality
- Ready to begin actual feature development

The project is in an excellent state for transitioning from planning to implementation. All documentation is comprehensive, consistent, and actionable.
