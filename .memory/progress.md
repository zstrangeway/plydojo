## Current Sprint/Iteration
**Goal**: Transition from planning to implementation phase
**Timeline**: 2025-05-23 - 2025-06-06

### Sprint Tasks
- [x] Align all documentation with screensList.md
- [x] Standardize function naming across all documents
- [x] Define complete DynamoDB schema
- [x] Specify technology choices (React Context API, AWS SES, etc.)
- [ ] Begin Priority 1.1: Frontend Setup (Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
- [ ] Begin Priority 1.2: Backend Infrastructure (SST, DynamoDB, Lambda)

## Backlog Priorities

## What's Working

### Infrastructure (Priority 1.1, 1.2, 1.3) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Frontend Foundation**: Next.js application with shadcn/ui components, proper TypeScript configuration, and build pipeline
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Complete SST v3 serverless deployment with all AWS services (API Gateway, DynamoDB, Lambda, Cognito, S3, CloudFront, SES)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Fully automatic staging → production deployment flow with health checks and monitoring
- **Development Environment**: Local development setup with proper tooling and configuration

### Key Technical Achievements
- **SST v3 Integration**: Successfully deployed with proper outputs.json handling (not CloudFormation)
- **Automatic Deployments**: Staging deployment triggers production automatically using github-script action
- **Health Check Validation**: Working API endpoints with proper error handling for deployment validation
- **Environment Separation**: Staging and production environments with proper secrets management
- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: CloudWatch alarms, dashboards, and SNS notifications deployed

### Development Workflow Established
- **Commit Message Conventions**: Conventional Commits standard with task ID scopes implemented
- **Interactive Rebase Process**: Successfully rewrote entire commit history to follow new format
- **Clean Git History**: All 9 commits now follow `<type>(scope): <description>` format with task IDs
- **Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive development workflow patterns documented in memory bank

## Recent Key Learnings (2025-05-28)

### SST v3 Deployment Insights
- **State Management**: SST v3 uses `.sst/outputs.json` instead of CloudFormation outputs
- **Domain Configuration**: Requires actual domain ownership; use placeholder emails for development
- **Infrastructure Differences**: Uses Pulumi/Terraform backend, not CloudFormation
- **Output Parsing**: Different approach needed compared to SST v2 for CI/CD integration

### CI/CD Pipeline Lessons
- **GitHub Actions Permissions**: `github-script` action works better than `repository-dispatch` for workflow triggers
- **Health Check Strategy**: Deployment should fail if health endpoints unreachable
- **Environment Variables**: Critical for multi-stage deployment success
- **Automatic Flow**: Staging → production automation works reliably with proper configuration

### Git Workflow Improvements
- **Task ID Placement**: Scope format `(1.2)` superior to bracket notation `[1.2]`
- **Interactive Rebase**: `git rebase -i --root` allows complete history rewrite
- **Vim Navigation**: `i` for insert, `Esc` to exit, `:wq` to save - essential for terminal editing
- **Force Push Safety**: `--force-with-lease` required after history rewrite
