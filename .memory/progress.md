## Current Sprint/Iteration
**Goal**: Transition from planning to implementation phase
**Timeline**: 2025-05-23 - 2025-06-06

### Sprint Tasks
- [x] Align all documentation with screensList.md
- [x] Standardize function naming across all documents
- [x] Define complete DynamoDB schema
- [x] Specify technology choices (React Context API, AWS SES, etc.)
- [ ] Begin Priority 1.1: Frontend Setup (Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
- [ ] Begin Priority 1.2: Backend Infrastructure (SST, DynamoDB, Lambda)

## Backlog Priorities
